##### Kubernetes Basics

This tutorial is on Kubernetes cluster orchestration system.

Each module contains some background info on major Kubernetes features and concepts.

Using interactive tutorials, we can learn to:

​	Deploy a containerized application on a cluster.

​	Scale the deployment.

​	Update the containerized application with a new software version.

​	Debug the containerized application.

##### What Kubernetes can do ?

With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times a day. Containerization helps package software to serve these goals, enabling applications to be released and updated without downtime. Kubernetes helps you make sure those containerized applications run where and when you want, and helps them find the resources and tools they need to work. Kubernetes is a production-ready, open source platform designed with Google's accumulated experience in container orchestration, combined with best-of-breed ideas from the community.
